### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Richard Clarke! (He/Him)

I'm a first year game development student at NSCC Truro in Nova Scotia, Canada. I'm in the programming track, with a focus on learning C# and Typescript. I hope to one day be a Technical Artist!

### Current Projects

For OOP class we are working on a text-based adventure game. My game is exploration focused, and the player will gain a variety of movement powers to help them explore the map and the mysteries it contains. Currently the player can gain a boat which lets them leave the starting island!

In Level Design class we are working on making a Tech Demo, and I'm fleshing it out into a full environment to be explored and enjoyed! I created my own pixel art for the UI elements as well!

### Previous Projects

I had the pleasure of participating in a game jam this past term with some of my fellow class-mates. We successfully built a game, and it's available on Itch.Io here - https://aliandris.itch.io/godflinger. My main contribution was working on the UI and related code, as well as sourcing SFX and BGM for the game. I also created some of the art assets. Finally I kept documentation for the team, which is also available on the game website.

This past winter holiday I worked on learning Unity2D, and as part of that exploration I created 'Amazing Ben's Radical Shredventure! Please check it out on itch.io here -> https://aliandris.itch.io/radicalshredventure
