### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Richard Clarke! (He/Him)

I'm a first year game development student at NSCC Truro in Nova Scotia, Canada. I'll be taking the programming track, and I will be focusing on learning how to be a technical artist for the industry. 

My favourite thing I've worked on so far was a 2D playable map. The goal was to read a map from an array, display it, and allow it to be resized. This project excited me so I went further and added a playable character, colours to the terrain, dungeons and map transitions, and randomized treasures!

I had the pleasure of participating in a game jam this past term with some of my fellow class-mates. We successfully built a game, and it's available on Itch.Io here - https://aliandris.itch.io/godflinger. My main contribution was working on the UI and related code, as well as sourcing SFX and BGM for the game. I also created some of the art assets. Finally I kept documentation for the team, which is also available on the game website.

This holiday season I plan to dig deeper into Shaders, and start learning more about them. Hopefully I'll have something to share when I come back in the spring!

Fun Fact: I was a teacher for nine years before starting over in game development! I've also written and published one book, a fantasy novel!
